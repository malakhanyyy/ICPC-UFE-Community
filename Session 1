# ICPC-UFE Community  Session 1 — C++ 
# Session 1 — Introduction to Problem Solving (PS)

**Objective:** Introduce participants to competitive programming mindset, problem-solving strategies, and foundational concepts for ICPC.

## 1. What is Problem Solving (PS)?

- Problem Solving in programming is the ability to **analyze a problem**, **devise a plan**, and **implement a solution efficiently**.  
- It involves thinking logically, breaking problems into smaller parts, and using programming constructs effectively.  
- ICPC problems test not only coding skills but **algorithmic thinking, accuracy, and efficiency**.

## 2. The Problem-Solving Process

1. **Understand the problem**  
   - Read the problem carefully.  
   - Identify the input and output requirements.  
   - Determine constraints and limits.

2. **Devise a plan (Algorithm)**  
   - Think of a step-by-step method to solve the problem.  
   - Break the problem into smaller, manageable pieces.  
   - Choose appropriate data structures (arrays, strings, sets, etc.)

3. **Implement the plan**  
   - Translate the algorithm into code using your preferred language (e.g., C++).  
   - Follow proper syntax, input/output, and data types.

4. **Test your solution**  
   - Use sample inputs to verify correctness.  
   - Check edge cases and special scenarios.

5. **Optimize**  
   - Analyze time and space complexity.  
   - Improve efficiency if necessary using algorithms or better data structures.

## 3. Key Concepts in Problem Solving

### a) Understanding the Problem
- Focus on **what is given** and **what is asked**.  
- Identify keywords and constraints.  
- Draw diagrams or examples to visualize the problem.

### b) Algorithms
- A **sequence of steps** to solve a problem.  
- Common beginner concepts:  
  - Sequential execution (step by step)  
  - Conditional execution (`if-else`)  
  - Repetition/loops (`for`, `while`)  
  - Simple calculations

### c) Data Structures
- Structures to store and organize data efficiently.  
- Common beginner structures:  
  - Variables  
  - Arrays  
  - Strings  
  - Boolean flags

### d) Logical Thinking
- Break problems into **smaller, manageable parts**.  
- Think of input/output examples and edge cases.  
- Use **patterns** and reasoning before coding.

## 4. Steps to Approach ICPC Problems

1. **Read the problem twice** — never assume anything.  
2. **Identify constraints** — e.g., N ≤ 1000 → O(N^2) may be acceptable.  
3. **Think of a naive solution first**, then improve it.  
4. **Use examples** — try sample input manually.  
5. **Write clean code** — easy to debug and maintain.  
6. **Test on edge cases** — empty input, large numbers, maximum/minimum limits.

## 5. Common Mistakes Beginners Make

- Misreading the problem or ignoring constraints.  
- Skipping the planning step and starting to code immediately.  
- Using the wrong data type (e.g., `int` instead of `long long`).  
- Not testing edge cases.  
- Writing messy or unstructured code.

## 6. Tips to Improve Problem Solving Skills

- **Practice regularly** — small daily practice beats occasional marathon sessions.  
- **Start simple** — focus on basic problems first.  
- **Learn by debugging** — errors teach more than correct submissions.  
- **Understand algorithms and patterns** — repetition, sorting, searching, etc.  
- **Participate in contests** — helps improve speed and accuracy under pressure.

---

## 7. Mindset for Problem Solving

- Be **patient** — some problems take time to understand.  
- Be **persistent** — don’t give up if the solution is not immediate.  
- Think **logically and step by step**.  
- Focus on **accuracy first**, then speed.  
- Collaborate and discuss concepts **outside contests** — never during contests.

## 8. Summary

Problem Solving is the **heart of competitive programming**.  
By understanding problems, planning algorithms, implementing correctly, and practicing regularly, beginners can build a strong foundation for ICPC and other contests.
